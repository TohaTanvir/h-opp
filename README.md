2. Classes and Objects
   - Defining classes and objects
   - Constructors and destructors
   - Instance variables and methods

3. Encapsulation and Access Modifiers
   - Public, private, protected access
   - Getters and setters
   - Benefits of encapsulation

4. Inheritance and Composition
   - Creating class hierarchies
   - Base and derived classes
   - Method overriding and super keyword

5. Polymorphism and Interfaces
   - Method overloading and overriding
   - Abstract classes and interfaces
   - Achieving runtime polymorphism

**Part II: Advanced OOP Concepts**

6. Design Principles and Patterns
   - SOLID principles: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
   - Common design patterns: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, and more

7. Composition over Inheritance
   - Understanding the pitfalls of deep inheritance hierarchies
   - Favoring composition for flexibility and maintainability

8. Exception Handling in OOP

**Part III: Applying OOP in Practice**

9. Designing Effective Class Structures
   - Identifying classes and responsibilities
   - Establishing relationships between classes
   - Creating cohesive and loosely coupled systems

10. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)
    - Gathering requirements and modeling concepts
    - Creating use cases, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams
    - Translating models into code

11. Testing and Debugging OOP Code
    - Unit testing and test-driven development (TDD)
